Do you know that PrestaShop 1.7.7 comes with 88 built-in modules? That is 88 ways for merchants to start their online store and empower their business, directly from their back office! :fire:

In this article, we will try to answer all your questions about this topic. So let’s get started!

## What is a built-in module exactly?

A built-in module is a module that was developed by PrestaShop and that is available in your back office either in the Module Manager or in the Module Catalog. 

We are not talking about "native modules" here, as the definition of a native module is a bit more complicated. Indeed, some native modules are present in the installation zip, some are pre-installed and some others are not. So, to make it easier, we have chosen to talk about built-in modules in this article.

## What are these modules made for? 

The built-in modules will help you empower your business. The Product team have organized them into 6 main categories:

**Traffic & Marketplace:** Increase your store awareness, traffic, and conversions.

**Promotions & Marketing:** Boost your sales and promote your catalog.

**Payment:** Use a payment module to make it easy for customers to purchase on your store.

**Facebook & Social network:** Easily build a community around your store.

**Design & Navigation:** Customize the design of your store and improve your site navigation to make it unique, engaging, and adapted to your business as well as your customer needs.

**Administration:** Simplify the daily management of your store. 

## Where can I find the list of all built-in modules?

There was a time where it was difficult to find the list of all built-in modules. You could have a part of it directly in the back office but half of the information was missing and most of it has not been updated (or worse, inherited from the 1.6 version). In the end, it was not helpful at all.

Dear PrestaShop users, those days are over! 

The PrestaShop company's core product team took some time to test all modules, screenshot them, accurately categorize them, write explicit and complete product information, translate it into eight languages, create special Addons pages for them and gather it all in a dedicated brochure available  [here](https://www.prestashop.com/fr/ressources).

This brochure, available in no less than 8 languages, will give you a complete overview of the natively available features that will help you empower your business!

Spoiler alert: It will soon be possible to click directly on the brochure to access its page on the PrestaShop Addons marketplace! A Russian version of the brochure will also be released soon.

## The current logos look a bit outdated, are you going to update them?

This redesign is part of our will to harmonize the overall experience on the software. We hope you will like it, don’t hesitate to share your feedback!”_

It was time for a new look! Our Design team did a great job at modernizing and freshening the logos. Icons are pretty much the same but their colors fit better with the PrestaShop identity, the user experience will be more consistent. 

These logos will be available in the back office during the first semester of 2021 (We have to wait for the QA to validate the pull requests, and for the releases to be done… Please just hold a little longer, you will soon be able to see it in your back office. To help you wait here is a little preview:

## What if I want to know more about a module in particular?

To know more about a specific module (whether it is a built-in module or not) you should visit the [PrestaShop Official Addons Marketplace](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/).

Our product managers have redesigned the built-in module pages on the marketplace to make them clearer and more understandable. 

Please note that you cannot download built-in modules on the Addons marketplace, as they are already available in both Modules sections of your back office. 

These modules pages on Addons are available in 9 languages. Check out these pages if you want to know what a module can do for you and how you can use it. 

You can also access these module pages directly from the back office, by clicking on a module.

What are the benefits for the merchants, the customers? So we created module pages in 9 languages, to gather all this information and make it available - like for any other module sold on the Addons marketplace!”_
